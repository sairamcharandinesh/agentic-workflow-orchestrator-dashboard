# Overview

This project provides a generic **agentic workflow orchestrator** with a web dashboard:

- **Frontend** — SvelteFlow-based node-edge editor for designing LangGraph/LangChain workflows
- **Backend** — FastAPI server to execute and monitor runs
- **Deployment** — Docker Compose for local dev; Kubernetes manifests for production

Use the UI to build graphs, connect nodes, and run them with Ollama or an online LLM API. See the main README for quick start and layout.
